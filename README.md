- Kite is a minimalistic, intuitive, responsive, light, yet powerful trading platform offered by Zerodha: https://kite.trade/docs/kite/

## Description
Manjha: Personal financial assistant and portfolio manager.
This is a chat-driven trading journal and portfolio intelligence workspace.
Users ask questions about their portfolio, and the system returns three synchronized outputs:
Manjha creates a mental model for himself, a discipline engine for you, and a journal for your portfolio. From scattered trades to disciplined, documented strategy.

Direct Answer Window
A clean, scrollable chat panel that gives a plain-language explanation to any question about P&L, holdings, risk, or behavior.
Chart/Widget Output
A second tab instantly shows a matching visual: P&L chart, sector exposure, win/loss streaks, trade heat maps, etc.

Flow-Chart / Mental Model Output
A third tab generates a personalized discipline engine: decision flows, risk rules, monthly habits, trade logic diagrams.
On the right, users can pin any chart/widget from the chat into a persistent board for later reference or journaling.
Behind the chat window, the wider screen is a trading journal layer with calendar view, trade summaries, behavioral insights and the pinned dashboards.

Knowledge Graph:
There will also a tab where we will create an editable knowledge graph for the user from all his chats, we have an graphitti server runnning. It will show the user all the assumptions and considerations the agent has made about you, kinda the first layer of discipline engine and mental model. Can use that!

The product is a portfolio companion that:
Explains performance
Visualizes answers
Builds mental models to improve discipline
Lets you pin insights to a dashboard in one tap

All from one question: “Why is my P&L negative this month?”
